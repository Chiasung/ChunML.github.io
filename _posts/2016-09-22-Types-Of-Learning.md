So here we are again, to continue what we dared to begin: challenging Machine Learning.

Before we move on, let's spend a minute to look back on the last post. You now know what Machine Learning is, it's something that contains a Model, some (Features, Labels) as inputs (remember we needed many Dog's images?) and some Activations as outputs (Dog or Not a Dog).
You also know what exactly Learning means. It's the process of Trial-and-Error repeatedly. Trial makes big mistakes in the first time, but help the computer (as well as human's brain) to learn faster, to become more confident on the next time.

Learning is doing something repeatedly, guys. So don't be ashamed to do some revision until you're ready to move on.
You can find the last tutorial here: [What is Machine Learning?](https://chunml.github.io/tutorial/Machine-Learning-Definition/)

So, let's get down to business. I'll make it easy for you today. It means today's post won't be such long as the lastest one. Even Cristiano Ronaldo needs some recovery-day, right?

What I want to talk to you today, is about types of Learning. So why the hell must we know about it. So imagine you're trying to learn piano in a mathematical way, it means that you treat those beautifully composed repertoires as some kind of, let's say those annoying matrices you saw yesterday. You'll soon realize it doesn't make any sense, logically. And even if you can play through it, but actually you just can't get it (if you're listening to classical music, then you will know what I mean).
So we have to admit that, different things require different learning approaches. If you choose an inappropriate way of learning, then it'll likely result in some unpleasant tragic.

Sounds like a headache here, right? But don't worry, it's not that complicated in the case of Machine Learning. Above I told you that you won't be able to get progressed in learning piano with some mathematical approach. In the case of Machine Learning, piano repertoires can be treated as Inputs. So different Input types do require different approach of learning. It does make some sense, right?
So, based on Input types, we can divide Machine Learning into three categories like below:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

And similarly, based on Output types, we can divide our Machine Learning problems into two categories like below:

* Regression Problem
* Classification Problem

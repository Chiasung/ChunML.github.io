So here we are again, to continue what we dared to begin: challenging Machine Learning.

Before we move on, let's spend a minute to look back on the last post. You now know what Machine Learning is, it's something that contains a Model, some (Features, Labels) as inputs (remember we needed many Dog's images?) and some Activations as outputs (Dog or Not a Dog).
You also know what exactly Learning means. It's the process of Trial-and-Error repeatedly. Trial makes big mistakes in the first time, but help the computer (as well as human's brain) to learn faster, to become more confident on the next time.

Learning is doing something repeatedly, guys. So don't be ashamed to do some revision until you're ready to move on.
You can find the last tutorial here: [What is Machine Learning?](https://chunml.github.io/tutorial/Machine-Learning-Definition/)

So, let's get down to business. I'll make it easy for you today. It means today's post won't be such long as the previous one. Even Cristiano Ronaldo needs some recovery-day, right?

What I want to talk to you today, is about types of Learning. So why the hell must we know about it. So imagine you're trying to learn piano in a mathematical way, it means that you treat those beautifully composed repertoires as some kind of, let's say those annoying matrices you saw yesterday. You'll soon realize it doesn't make any sense, logically. And even if you can play through it, but actually you just can't get it (if you're listening to classical music, then you will know what I mean).
So we have to admit that, different things require different learning approaches. If you choose an inappropriate way of learning, then it'll likely result in some unpleasant tragic.

Sounds like a headache here, right? But don't worry, it's not that complicated in the case of Machine Learning. Above I told you that you won't be able to get progressed in learning piano with some mathematical approach. In the case of Machine Learning, piano repertoires can be treated as Inputs. So different Input types do require different approach of learning. It does make some sense, right?
So, based on Input types, we can divide Machine Learning into three categories like below:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning
First, as you may know (in fact I think you don't even care), that I'm currently live in Japan (I'm not an Japanese, though). When I tried to learn some Machine Learning's vocabularies in Japanese, I discovered some couple of interesting things. One of those is Supervised Learning term. Why am I telling you this? Because I think it may help you understand this term easily. They call it "Learning with a teacher" in Japanese. Does it make some sense to you? When your parents sat by your side and taught you each picture was about, they acted just like you teachers. When you tried to learn for you SAT or GMAT, it was not you who learned by yourselves! So where you got those vocabularies from? From your teachers? From you instruction books? Doesn't matter, at least you learned from some sources. Or I can say, you were learning under the supervision of something. It means you knew what were right and what were wrong.
Everything is exactly the same in Machine Learning, Supervised Learning indicates that the computer knows whether it made it right or not. How does it know? Remember the Dog Recognition example on the previous post? Yep, it used the Labels to evaluate its work. So, whenever you see a Machine Learning problem where Labels provided along with Features, that's definitely Supervised Learning.

### Unsupervised Learning

### Reinforcement Learning

And similarly, based on Output types, we can divide our Machine Learning problems into two categories like below:

* Regression Problem
* Classification Problem

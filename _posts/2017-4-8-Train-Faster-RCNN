Hi guys! So I've been away for three months to do a project for my company, and unfortunately, in another prefecture. During that time, I received quite a lot of comments from you guys abou what I wrote before. Some said that my blog posts did help them a lot and told me to keep writing.
To be honest, I was really really happy to hear that. And as long as my blog can be helpful, I will continue to write more and more posts (hope that they will be useful, too).
Besides, I also received comments from you guys about the problems you came across while you were following my instructions. And I'm so sorry that I was so messed up with my work that I couldn't be any helpful (although I said I would try to help).
